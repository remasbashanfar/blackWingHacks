Project Description:

# Inspiration
Mental Health is extremely important to all of us especially during these trying times of COVID-19. So we wanted to make something that would help people track their mental health and keep a record of their mood while simultaneously reminding them of their memories in previous months, or even years!

# What it does
It lets you fill out a form every day, reflecting and monitoring your mood. Based on your answers and mood, it will suggest some things to do to handle your mental health in a better way. Then, it will save all of the answers in a calendar so that one could go back and monitor their mood or enjoy reading their daily reflections and memories.

# How we built it
We built it using php, ajax, html, css, js, jquery, firebase, git and github. Each one of us had different experiences and we were able to successfully integrate all of our skills to create a project made of many languages.

# Challenges we ran into
We had some issues with firebase authentication and PHP integration. Looking for solutions online and asking mentors was extremely helpful to keep the process going and solve the problem.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to make something that supports mental health, and we are the biggest fans of our work as we will start monitoring our mood daily through our own creation :)

# What we learned
Collaborating on this project was tough because we were in different timezones (we are from 3 different countries!) However, we were able to communicate effectively by creating a list of things to do and updating each other on our progress, and openly asking for help when needed.

# What's next for Spread Your Wings
We plan on creating a Discord Bot that helps the user be positive when they are feeling down or lonely. We are also planning on adding more features that include personalized self-care reminders and stress-relieving games.
